####Adding Resume Content



Settings
------

Within the `neueresume` directory, you'll find `settings.php`. Here you can configure a handful
of settings, which are listed below. Any setting can be set in either the root `settings.php` or a settings file at the
root of a theme (though some are more useful in one place than the other). All of these functions 
are part of the NeueResume class under the settings object and can be accessed in theme files with 
`$this->settings` as a prefix.
